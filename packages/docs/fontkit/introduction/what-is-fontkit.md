# What is `@pdfa-lab/fontkit`?

Fontkit is an advanced font engine for Node and the browser
written in TypeScript.

## Features

* Supports TrueType (`.ttf`), OpenType (`.otf`), WOFF (`.woff`), WOFF2 (`.woff2`), TrueType Collection (`.ttc`), and Datafork TrueType (`.dfont`) font files.
* Enables mapping characters to glyphs, including support for ligatures and other advanced substitutions.
* Reads glyph metrics and lays out glyphs, including support for kerning and other advanced layout features.
* Handles advanced OpenType features including glyph substitution (GSUB) and positioning (GPOS)
* Apple Advanced Typography (AAT) glyph substitution features (morx table).
* Support for getting glyph vector paths and converting them to SVG paths, or rendering them to a graphics context.
* Supports TrueType (glyf) and PostScript (CFF/CFF2) outlines.
* Support for color glyphs (e.g. emoji), including Apple’s SBIX table, and Microsoft’s COLR table.
* Support for AAT variation glyphs, allowing for nearly infinite design control over weight, width, and other axes.
* Font subsetting support - create a new font including only the specified glyphs.

## Improvements in `@pdfa-lab/fontkit`

* Fully Typed Architecture: Re-engineered from the ground up in native TypeScript, offering robust auto-completion, strict compiler checks, and inline documentation for complex internal font structures (such as layout tables and glyph collections).
* API documentation; you are currently reading it.
* Modern ESM Native & CJS Layouts: Shipped with strict, modern dual-package support (.js and .cjs), eliminating old bundler quirks and offering out-of-the-box support for modern frameworks (Vite, Next.js, etc.) alongside backward-compatible UMD browser targets.
* Modernised Engineering Tooling: Replaced aging, custom hand-crafted build scripts with modern tooling (Rollup/Vite) and an overhauled, modern testing pipeline (Vitest/Jest).

## The Typescript Shift

The primary limitation of the original codebase and its early forks was the
reliance on loose JavaScript objects to represent complex, low-level binary
specifications (like OpenType and AAT structures).

By porting @pdfa-lab/fontkit to strict TypeScript, the library has been turned
internal structural contracts into a form of static analysis. This migration
has eliminated legacy silent bugs, clearly define cross-module 
internal boundaries (like table registration schemes), and dramatically 
improve the developer experience for anyone building advanced layout or PDF 
rendering engines.

## History of `fontkit`

The [original version of fontkit](https://github.com/foliojs/fontkit) was
written by [Devon Govett](https://github.com/devongovett) in JavaScript.

Later, [Andrew Dillon](https://github.com/Hopding) created a fork
[`@pdf-lib/fontkit`](https://github.com/Hopding/fontkit) that was mainly
focused on improving browser compatibility. It was used by the
popular [`pdf-lib`](https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib) project by the same
author. Because `pdf-lib` has not seen any updates for years, an actively
maintained fork [`@cantoo/pdf-lib`](https://github.com/cantoo-scribe/pdf-lib)
has been created.

There is another popular fontkit fork
[`@foliojs-fork/fontkit`](https://github.com/foliojs-fork/fontkit#readme)
that included many improvements and bug fixes to the original fontkit.

This version `@pdfa-lab/fontkit` is based on the original fontkit and the
two forks. It tries to incorporate all improvements in the other forks.

The main advantage of `@pdfa-lab/fontkit` is that the original codebase has
been ported to TypeScript, which improves developer experience significantly.
