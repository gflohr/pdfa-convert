# PDFA-lab<!--omit-from-toc-->

This project is currently a work in progress. It is a supplement
to the Cantoo fork of [pdf-lib](https://github.com/cantoo-scribe/pdf-lib).

		- [`fontkit` Replacement](#fontkit-replacement)
	- [Limitations and Caveats](#limitations-and-caveats)
		- [CJK Scripts](#cjk-scripts)

## Description

In the future, it will hopefully help with these things:

* upgrading regular PDFs to PDF/A-1b, PDF/A-2b, or PDF/A-3b
* replacing/embedding fonts in PDFs
* subsetting fonts in PDFs
* manipulation of XMP metadata in PDFs
* allow access to the Adobe Glyph List Specification
* ...

The software is written in TypeScript. It consists of a command-line
interface and a library.

## Current State

### Text Extraction

The software can extract text from many, but not all PDFs:

```
pnpm install
cd apps/cli
pnpm start:dev text PATH_TO_PDF
```

### `fontkit` Replacement

The package [`@pdf-lib/fontkit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pdf-lib/fontkit)
is unmaintained and known to have bugs that prevent font embedding from
working reliably. However, short of other options, it is the `fontkit`
implementation recommended by
[`pdf-lib`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-lib) and its actively maintained
fork [`@cantoo/pdf-lib`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cantoo/pdf-lib).

This project contains a drop-in replacement for `@pdf-lib/fontkit`, see its
[README](./packages/fontkit/README.md). The replacement aims at fixing the
known bugs in the existing implementation. It will probably be available as
`@pdfa-lab/fontkit`.

## Limitations and Caveats

### CJK Scripts

Documents that use CJK scripts will probably not work. If they do not work,
please provide at least one example file that reproduces the issue.

If they work, the author is grateful to hear from you about it.
